# GAN pytorch
This is a simple GAN created using pytorch

Dataset has 63k images with 64x64 resolution each. I reccomend to run less than 300 epochs.

To run it you will need to install these libraries:
pip install torch
pip install torchvision
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install moviepy
